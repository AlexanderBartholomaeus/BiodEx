# BiodEx - biodiversity explorer for exploration of microbial community biodiversity 

BiodEx is a user-friendly tool for exploration of microbial community biodiversity. It is developed as a collaboration between the [GFZ](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de) (German Centre for Geosciences) - [GeoMicrobiology section/lab](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/geomicrobiology/overview/), The [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/en) - [Aaron Kaplan lab](https://kaplanlab.wixsite.com/kaplanlab) and the [UFZ](https://www.ufz.de/)(Centre for Environmental Research) - [Microbial Data Science group](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=43659).

### Link to the tool

A test version of the tool can be found here: http://shiny.raccoome.de/biodiversity/ with the password `OTU`. Please note that this is a test version, we are working on the final version.

### Publication

We are finishing the publication entitled: *Biodiversity Explorer (BiodEx) â€“ a user-friendly tool for exploration of microbial community biodiversity*

### Our vision 

With BiodEx we want to create a community driven and community developed tool. We are convinced that this is necessary to develop a tool with broad applicability and keep up with the fast evolving field of metagenomics. 

The tool will be easy by an intuitive user-interface and flexible to run as it will run locally and in the web.
